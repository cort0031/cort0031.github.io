        <p>Hello!, my name is Martin, I'm an International Student enrolled in the <abbr title= "Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> course. I came from Mexico all the way to Canada to become a multidisciplinary artist. <strong>I love art</strong> and everything that has to do with creativity, and I'd like to express myself any kind of media possible, including digital art and web development as this is where the industry has moved worldwide.</p>
        <p>The things I like to do involve drawings, from animation to <em>manga</em>. I admire every type of illustration and some of my inspirations include graphics novels from Hiroyuki Takei, Eichiiro Oda, Sarah Pichelli, Humberto Ramos, and writing from Brian Michael Bendis, George R.R. Martin and J.R.R. Toklien. Speaking of Tolkien, some of the things I've read from him reminded me the reason when I ask myself "What am I doing in this place far away from home?".</p>
